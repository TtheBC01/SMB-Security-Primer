# Passwords and Password Managers

If you find yourself using passwords that look something like, `t0dd1987$` (i.e. some combo of you or one of your family member's names plus a year), it is literally
only a matter of time before your account is broken in to. Sophisticated (and even unsophisted) cyber criminals in every country in the world use automated tools to look up public information
about you, your family, and any publicly available information about your company to guess common password patterns that people have been using for decades. Additionally, if you are reusing the same password (or a variation 
of it) on multiple sites, as soon as the first site is comprimised, your other accounts are basically as good as gone. 

A better password would look something like, `tc]Mxh1UJaXP4dmo`, a totaly random selection of 16 characters (please don't use my example or a tweak of it, 
it is already on the open internet!). If your aren't convinced yet to worry about this, you should know that a bad password can easily 
[cost your business tens of thousands of dollars](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/small-business-cyber-security-statistics) that you will likely not be able to get back. 

But comming up with a random password is hard, and remembering it is even harder! And how am I supposed to keep track of all the passwords I need for all of my accounts
and find them when I need them in a hurry? This page will explain to you in plain english the basics of password security and how you can make your life easier  
(and more secure) using a helpful piece of software called a *password manager*.
